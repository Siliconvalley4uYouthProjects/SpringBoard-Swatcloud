cisco crosswork cloud is a saas solution that provides operational insight and validation of network health and security with the agility and scale of the cloud. the crosswork network insights bgp analytics engine enriches routing data with additional data sources such as rpki, whois, and ip geolocation, reducing the time it takes to identify malicious activity or repair routing errors. network insights further leverages these data to provide rich analysis, visualization, and alerting on actionable network events, saving network operators time, and increasing service availability. crosswork traffic analysis aggregates traffic flow data across multiple devices, giving operators a view of the traffic matrix across the whole network. it adds critical context to observed traffic flows based on the existing rich data sets of routing data from the crosswork network insights service. this allows operators to gain a deeper understanding of traffic flows on their networks, as well as the impacts of changes in external and internal routing state and policy. traffic analysis enables network operators to engineer automated peering solutions as well as understand the impact of new peering to their network infrastructure.
at cisco, each person brings their unique talents to work as a team and make a difference. yes, our technology changes the way the world works, lives, plays, and learns, but our edge comes from our people.

#wearecisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. here’s how we do it.
we embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. and a security company. a blockchain company. an ai/machine learning company. we even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. no other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
but “digital transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
day to day, we focus on the give and take. we give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our dna.) we take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

you revel in the opportunity to do it all; from desktop to web, to production deployment!

this job may not be for you if:
you only code alone and aren't willing to mentor and be mentored.
you lack a real passion for writing high-quality secure software that is backed by an equally mature approach to testing.
you stress under the ambiguity of a problem and default to others to provide you with the answers.
your first instinct is to point out why something can’t be done rather than focusing on what the customer problem is.
you tire at the thought of a steady, deliberate pace in both a product and company.

intern program overview:
meraki interns and co-ops join the team for 12 and 16 week programs, respectively, and are placed directly onto sub-teams. during the program, interns/co-ops have the opportunity to work on a small starter project, such as integration and implementation of new tools, before spending the majority of the program on a larger project, such as building the infrastructure for a new service. projects are cross functional, which allow insight into new languages and technologies, help encourage professional growth within engineering, and allow a sense of ownership within the team.
meraki’s engineering teams place a high emphasis on mentorship. each intern and co-op is matched 1:1 with a mentor who provides continual feedback and guidance throughout the duration of the program. mentors help with introductions to other team members, overviews of tools and processes, and provide a seamless integration into meraki life.

#wearecisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. here’s how we do it.
we embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. and a security company. a blockchain company. an ai/machine learning company. we even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. no other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
but “digital transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
day to day, we focus on the give and take. we give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our dna.) we take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

 #wearecisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all. 
 we embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. and a security company. we even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. no other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box! 
 but “digital transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.) 
 day to day, we focus on the give and take. we give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our dna.) we take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

#wearecisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all. 
we embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. and a security company. we even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. no other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
but “digital transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
day to day, we focus on the give and take. we give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our dna.) we take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

#wearecisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. here’s how we do it.
we embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. and a security company. an ai/machine learning company. we even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. no other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
but “digital transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.) 
day to day, we focus on the give and take. we give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our dna.) we take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

but “digital transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
day to day, we focus on the give and take. we give our best, we give our egos a break, and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our dna.) we take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

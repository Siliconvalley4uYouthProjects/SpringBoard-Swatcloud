311,JnJ,Toxicology Data Scientist Intern," We currently have one Summer Intern position in the Biochemical Toxicology Group (La Jolla, CA) to participate in studies focused on concordance of preclinical toxicity and clinical adverse drug reactions. Preclinical toxicology studies play an essential role in drug development for the evaluation of potential safety risks. Nonetheless, numerous analyses revealed that the safety phenotypes were not adequately predicted in animals, which remains a major contributor to drug attrition in the late development stages. To improve our ability to predict human risk, there is a need to systematically evaluate and quantify the concordance of adverse events (AEs) between animal models and clinical studies. In this work, we aim to integrate preclinical and clinical toxicological data archived in different sources and analyze all phenotypic events in preclinical species and humans to create a database of concordances with statistical metrics. Experimental variables such as drug type, dose, exposure, administration route, and tox severity grade level will also be retrieved and explored in the analysis. This powerful data driven approach that computes both statistical significance and predictive power, will provide useful information to help understand (non)translatable AEs across species. The results can be valuable for assessing the likelihood of potential clinical risk based on animal observations, guiding species selection, as well as improving in vitro/in vivo work for new and better preclinical safety markers for endpoints with low concordance. This assignment offers the opportunity to work as part of a cross-functional team in a pharmaceutical laboratory setting. This direct exposure will allow the student to participate in the planning, execution, analysis and reporting under the guidance of experienced scientists. Interested candidates should have a strong desire to learn the drug development process and contribute to improving the health of people worldwide.

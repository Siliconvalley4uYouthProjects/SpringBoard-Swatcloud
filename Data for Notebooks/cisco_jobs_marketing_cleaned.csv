but “digital transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
day to day, we focus on the give and take. we give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our dna.) we take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

#wearecisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. here’s how we do it.
we embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. and a security company. an ai/machine learning company. we even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. no other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
but “digital transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
day to day, we focus on the give and take. we give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our dna.) we take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

#wearecisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team on innovative technology and powering a more inclusive future for all. how do we do it? well, for starters – with people like you!
we embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their businesses. sure, we’re a company that’s 35 years strong and maybe you’ve heard we’re a hardware company. but we’re also a software company. a security company. an ai/machine learning company. we even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns, and protects. and we’re the tech behind keeping the world connected, productive, and ever adapting in our hybrid world by way of webex.
day to day, our teams have each other’s backs. we tackle whatever challenge comes our way, we recognize our accomplishments, and we grow together. we celebrate one another – from big life moments to big career moments. and giving back is in our dna (we get 5 days off each year to do just that too)!
what’s powering an inclusive future for all look like? we know that without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality, there is no moving forward. our 30 inclusive communities are leading the way, and together we’re committed to learning, listening, caring for our communities, and supporting the most vulnerable through our innovation, amazing culture, and a collective effort to make this world a better place.

we are cisco
#wearecisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. here’s how we do it.
we embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. and a security company. a blockchain company. an ai/machine learning company. we even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. no other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
but “digital transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
day to day, we focus on the give and take. we give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our dna.) we take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
so, you have colorful hair? don’t care. tattoos? show off your ink. like polka dots? that’s cool.

we embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. and a security company. we even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. no other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
but “digital transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
day to day, we focus on the give and take. we give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our dna.) we take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

#wearecisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. here’s how we do it.
we embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. and a security company. an ai/machine learning company. we even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. no other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
but “digital transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.) 
day to day, we focus on the give and take. we give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our dna.) we take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

#wearecisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. here’s how we do it.
we embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. and a security company. a blockchain company. an ai/machine learning company. we even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns, and protects. no other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
but “digital transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
day to day, we focus on the give and take. we give our best; we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our dna.) we take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

we embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. and a security company. an ai/machine learning company. we even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. no other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
but “digital transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

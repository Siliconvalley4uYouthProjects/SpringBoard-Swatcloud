flexible, hybrid work
we use a hybrid way of working that is primarily virtual, while remaining near the locations global tech calls home. this approach helps us make quicker decisions, remove location barriers across our global team, be more flexible in our personal lives and spend less time commuting. of course, being together in person is an important part of our culture and shared success. we use our campuses to collaborate and be together in person, as business needs require and for development and networking opportunities.

benefits:
beyond our great compensation package, you can receive incentive awards for your performance. other great perks include 401(k) match, stock purchase plan, paid maternity and parental leave, pto, multiple health plans, and much more.

equal opportunity employer:
walmart, inc. is an equal opportunity employer – by choice. we believe we are best equipped to help our associates, customers and the communities we serve live better when we really know them. that means understanding, respecting and valuing diversity- unique styles, experiences, identities, ideas and opinions – while being inclusive of all people.
